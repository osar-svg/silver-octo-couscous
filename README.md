# ✅ Serial Number Structure Diagram
Simple SVG diagram that visually defines the Serial Number Structure and explains each part of the format:

MLM-YYYYMM-UplineID-MemberID



# 🔧 SVG Logo: OSAR
Format: XML (SVG)

Colors: Yellow (#FFD700) and Black (#000000)

Font: #free-solid-font (Note: SVGs can only reference fonts that are available or embedded. We'll simulate the idea by naming the font, but for full effect you'll need to load the font in CSS/HTML.)

Happy designing, and good luck with OSAR! 🟡⚫
