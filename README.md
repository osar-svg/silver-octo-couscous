Creating simple SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images is easy and can be done using:

# 1. Manual Coding (using plain text)
SVG is XML-based, so you can create images with a text editor.

# Example: A red circle
# Quick SVG Examples: Rectangle
# Quick SVG Examples: Line
# Quick SVG Examples: Text - Hello SVG

You can:
- Save this as a .svg file and open it in a browser.
- Embed it directly into HTML.

# 2. Online SVG Editors
No coding needed. Try: export designs as SVG

# 3. Graphics Software
Use drawing tools that support SVG export:
- Adobe Illustrator

# 4. JavaScript Libraries (for dynamic SVGs)
If you're coding for the web...

# Here's a simple SVG logo using:
# Text: OSAR
# Font: #free-solid-font (Note: SVGs can only reference fonts that are available or embedded. We'll simulate the idea by naming the font, but for full effect you'll need to load the font in CSS/HTML.)
# Colors: Yellow (#FFD700) and Black (#000000)
# Format: XML (SVG)

# 🔧 SVG Logo: OSAR

# ✅ How to Use It:
- Save it as osar-logo.svg.
- You can embed it in an HTML page or open it in a browser.
- If #free-solid-font is a custom or local font, you need to embed it using CSS or base64 in the <style> section or host it on the web.

# Happy designing, and good luck with OSAR! 🟡⚫
